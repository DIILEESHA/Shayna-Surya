          After nine years together, we’re finally getting married! Our story
          began in 2017 one weekend in Washington, D.C., when mutual friends
          introduced us. Surya had just moved to Virginia after completing
          university in New York, and Shayna was in her final semester of
          college. After months of persistence, Surya convinced Shayna to go on
          a date to a Nationals game, though, as it turns out, neither of us
          actually liked baseball. Instead, we spent the night talking for
          hours, unaware that it would be the start of something that would
          change the course of our lives.
          <br />
          <br />
          From that night on, we were inseparable, even when Surya shared that
          he’d be moving back home to Dubai, placing oceans between us. The next
          few years were filled with endless phone calls, numerous flights, and
          the shared anticipation of one day being in the same city again. In
          2022, Shayna made the move to Dubai, and we began building our life
          together.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2024, we got engaged in one of our favorite cities, Istanbul, and
          now we can’t wait to celebrate our marriage in Dubai and Sri Lanka,
          honoring our roots and surrounded by the people we love most.
